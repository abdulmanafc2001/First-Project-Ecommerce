# eCommerce Backend API

## Overview

This is a backend API for an eCommerce application developed using the Gin framework, PostgreSQL with GORM, and several additional packages for validation, authentication, and documentation. It also integrates Razorpay for payment gateway functionality.

## Features

- **Gin Framework:** The project is built using the Gin web framework, which is known for its speed and performance.

- **PostgreSQL with GORM:** The database is powered by PostgreSQL, and GORM is used as the Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library, simplifying database operations.

- **Validation Package:** We use the validate package to validate the data structures, ensuring data integrity and security.

- **JWT Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for authentication and authorization, providing a secure way to access protected resources.

- **PDF Generation:** The project includes a PDF generation package for creating and managing PDF documents, which can be useful for generating invoices, receipts, or other documents.

- **Swagger Documentation:** Swagger is integrated into the project to automatically generate API documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and test the API endpoints.

- **Razorpay Integration:** Razorpay is integrated as the payment gateway, allowing users to make payments securely and efficiently.
